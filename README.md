# 🌸 Cosmetic Prompt Library

This project is a futuristic web application designed to help users generate cosmetic product-focused prompts for AI-powered image generation tools (e.g., ChatGPT DALL-E or other text-to-image models). Users can customize prompts by adjusting various parameters or leverage pre-defined creative prompts, then easily copy them for use on image generation platforms.

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** Customize prompts by selecting parameters like aspect ratio, camera lens, and lighting.
* **Diverse Scene & Mood Tones:** Each prompt comes with rich, detailed scene descriptions and specific mood/emotion tones.
* **Creative Naming:** Unique and inspiring names assigned to each prompt card.
* **Easy Copying:** Copy customized prompts to the clipboard with a single click.
* **ChatGPT Integration:** Conveniently open ChatGPT directly with the copied prompt.
* **Original Prompt Copying:** Option to copy the prompt's original version, unaffected by user modifications.
* **Futuristic & Premium Design:** An aesthetic interface designed with modern UI/UX principles, enriched with a dark theme and neon accents.
* **Fully Responsive:** Provides a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 🚀 Technologies

* **React.js:** For building the user interface.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid and responsive styling.
